# env is suddenly corrupted
no solution found


# streaming video + not freezing application (threading)
temporary fix;
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, threaded=True)

todo; geventlet for production


# page reload --> opencv error
hard-code in front-end that img src needs to be emptied --> opencv deletes camera object


# tensorflow code
can't reuse tf object, graphs are wrong.
Tried a lot, not fixed. Only possible way is how it's now


# REUSE VM GENERATOR FOR MULTIPLE CLIENTS	
can not fix. All client's should use the same generator object, instead is it created every time.
--> multiple clients while dreaming
--> appliation crashes because dream is happening for x clients
--> TF GPUs out of sync
